# .dotfiles

These dotfiles are intended to be used on a WSL Ubuntu setup using Windows Terminal.

## Installation

On a fresh installation of WSL Ubuntu:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkrodocker/dotfiles/remote-install.sh | bash
```

Or, if `curl` isn't available, instead clone directly into the desired location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkrodocker/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```
